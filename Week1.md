# Revisiting Milgram and Kishino's Reality-Virtuality Continuum

## Discontinuity in the RV Continuum
- the original RV continuum is discontinuous, suggesting that achieving a state of "perfect" virtual reality is unattainable
- any technology-mediated reality inherently involves a mix of real and virtual elements, thereby classifying it as mixed reality

## Expanded Definition of Mixed Reality
- mixed reality (MR) has been defined as environments where real and virtual objects coexist within a single display

## Revised Taxonomy Incorporating User Experience
- Extent of World Knowledge (EWK): The system's understanding of the real world, including the location and identity of objects.
- Immersion (IM): Combining reproduction fidelity and the extent of presence metaphor to describe the system's ability to support valid actions and interactions.
- Coherence: The consistency and logical integration of real and virtual elements within the experience.

# Difference between VR, AR, MR, XR
- Virtual Reality (VR) - Digital environment replace real world, blocks out physical world, immerses in fully computer generated space.
- Augmented Reality (AR) - Digital content overlays the real world but does not interact with it.
- Mixed Reality (MR) - A blend of AR and VR, digital contend interacts with the real world in real-time.
- Extended Reality (XR) - umbrella term that includes VR, AR, MR
