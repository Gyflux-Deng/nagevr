Reality-Virtuality(RV) Continuum
- Extent of World Knowledge
  - Refers to how much knowledge the system has about the physical or virtual environment.
  - Examples:
    - A basic AR app that overlays graphics without understanding the 3D space (low extent of world knowledge).
    - A sophisticated MR system with real-time spatial mapping, like Microsoft HoloLens, which recognizes surfaces, distances, and objects (high extent of world knowledge).
- Reproduction Fidelity
  - Refers to how accurately the system replicates sensory input to represent the real or virtual world.
  - Examples:
    - Low fidelity: Pixelated graphics, flat audio, and no tactile feedback.
    - High fidelity: 4K resolution, spatial audio, and precise haptics.
- Extent of Presence Metaphor
  - Refers to how the system supports a user's sense of presence by integrating natural and intuitive interactions or metaphors that align with the real world.
  - Examples:
    - Low extent: Systems where users rely on abstract or non-intuitive inputs (e.g., pressing buttons on a keyboard to navigate).
    - High extent: Systems using natural metaphors, like VR gloves to pick up virtual objects or walking in place to move in VR.
- Coherence
  - Refers to the consistency and logical integration of elements within the virtual or augmented environment.
  - Examples
    - Low coherence: Inconsistent lighting, objects behaving unrealistically (e.g., passing through walls).
    - High coherence: Realistic physics, seamless integration of virtual objects into the real world in AR, or logical narrative and rules in VR.

The Concept of Presence
- Place illusion
  - "The objects in the (virtual) room feels like they are really here. I even bumped into the wall in my real room because I lost track of my actual surroundings"
- Plausibility illusion
  - â€œI immediately duck as it really felt like I was in danger when the enemies attacked me, even though I knew it was just a game. I mean the graphics aren't even realistic."

Some history trivia stuff
- VR was invented in the 21st Century - False
- Which device sparked the current rise of VR - Oculus Rift DK1

## Week 2

Key Dimensions of Presence, Flow, and Cybersickness
- Presence:
  - The psychological sense of "being there" in a virtual or augmented environment.
  - Key Factors: Realism, interactivity, and user attention contribute to a higher sense of presence.
- Flow:
  - The mental state of being fully absorbed and engaged in an activity, often described as "being in the zone."
  - A balance between challenge and skill, clear goals, and immediate feedback.
- Cybersickness:
  - A form of motion sickness caused by discrepancies between visual input and physical sensation.
  - Symptoms: Nausea, dizziness, and fatigue.
  - Causes: Lag in system response, mismatched field of view, or unnatural motion cues.

The Role of Affordances in Immersive Experiences
- Definition: Affordances are the perceived possibilities for action provided by an object or environment.
- In Immersive Experiences:
  - Interaction Design: Users should easily understand how to interact with virtual objects (e.g., pulling a lever in VR that behaves like a real-world lever).
  - Intuitive Interfaces: The environment should leverage natural gestures and behaviors to enhance immersion.
  - Enhancing Engagement: By designing affordances that align with user expectations, the experience feels more intuitive and immersive (e.g., walking naturally to move in VR).

Types of Qustionnaires
- SSQ: Simulator Sickness Questionnaire
- CSQ: Cybersickness Questionnaire
