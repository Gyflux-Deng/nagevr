## Link 2 - User Experiences Across VR Walking-in-place Locomotion Methods

**Objective:**
- To evaluate user experiences with various easy-to-setup WIP methods in a VR commuting simulation.

**Methodology:**
- Conducted a user study involving 40 participants.
- Participants experienced multiple WI(Walking-in-Place) methods during the simulation.

**Findings:**
- The study provides insights into user preferences and the effectiveness of different WIP techniques.
- Highlights the importance of selecting appropriate WIP methods to enhance user comfort and immersion in VR environments.

**Why Use WIP in VR:**
- Space Efficiency – Allows users to navigate large virtual environments without needing a big physical area.
- Motion Sickness Reduction – Feels more natural compared to joystick-based movement, reducing discomfort.
- Increased Immersion – Simulating natural walking can enhance the sense of presence in VR.
